# PLUC_Mozambique
This is the PCRaster Land Use Change model (PLUC) for Mozambique, created in PCRaster Python. The aim of the model is to evaluate where bio energy crops can be cultivated without endangering food production now and in the near future when population and thus food crop and pasture areas will increase. Results of the model are published in Verstegen et al. 2012 and van der Hilst et al. 2012.
